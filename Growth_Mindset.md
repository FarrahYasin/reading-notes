# Prep: The Growth Mindset

**<span style="color:red"> Growth Mindset ðŸ’»ðŸ“—</span>**

 ***why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module?***
 Having a growth mindset is very important in order to continue self-development, overcome difficult challenges, and invest time in learning new skills.

 ### These are the ideas I deduced from the existing article and videos:

 1. **Deliberate practice**
From this article I conclude that it is very important to deliberately practice our hard technical skills in software development. Working on software projects consistently every day does not necessarily improve programming skills. It is important to push ourselves outside our comfort zones although this is something that takes a lot of effort to achieve but it must be done in order to develop ourselves. Self-education is very important, in addition to setting goals that help a lot in acquiring new skills.

 2. **Growth Mindset**
When we get a failure mark, we feel very frustrated and say that we have not accomplished anything and will not reach our goal, but when we get a mark (not yet) we will feel that we are still on the path of learning and we are not a failure.
It is important that we face difficult challenges because it is important that we understand that we must develop our capabilities (we must have a developed and not fixed mentality).
When we have a developed mentality, this thing helps us develop our skills with great doubt, and we will be able to learn from mistakes and fix them.
Every time we push ourselves out of our comfort zone in order to learn something new and difficult, the neurons in our brains will be able to form new strong relationships and with time we will become smarter and we will feel better because our abilities are always subject to development.

 3. **Grit**
IQ is not the only difference between the best and the worst people, it is important to have patience and perseverance to achieve long-term goals, and you must have the ability to bear difficulties and always work hard, and strive for the future.
The ability to learn is not fixed, but the ability to learn is subject to change through people's effort.

 4. **Success**
 When people have a growth mindset, this helps us define the concept of success and we will be able to achieve it with patience and continuous work in order to reach our goals, success and reaching the top is an acquired thing.
