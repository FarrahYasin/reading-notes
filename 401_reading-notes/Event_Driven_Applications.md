# Readings: Event Driven Applications


**Event Driven Applications** ðŸ’»

 ***Why is the topic of stacks and queues important in relation to your studies in this module?***
event-driven programming its important because it provides a flexible and efficient approach to handle events, asynchronous operations, and user interactions. It is particularly valuable in scenarios where responsiveness, modularity, extensibility, and scalability are important considerations, such as web applications, graphical user interfaces (GUI), real-time systems, and networked applications.

## Event Driven Programming

1. **What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?**

**events** module

2. **What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?**

OOP helps a lot to organize the code into reusable objects, making it easier to manage and maintain also. OOP allows for encapsulation of data and behavior, leading to cleaner and more modular code. When combined with Event Driven Programming, OOP enables us to create event handlers as methods within objects, making the code more structured and readable.

3. **Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.**

Event Driven Programming on the backend using Node.js it very usefull allows developers to build highly responsive  applications. its like how events in the web browser trigger actions like  form submissions, on the backend, events can be used to handle incoming requests, database queries, or external API calls. By utilizing Event Driven Programming, Node.js can efficiently handle multiple requests concurrently, providing scalability and responsiveness also. This approach is particularly useful for building real-time applications, like collaborative tools for example, where immediate responses are more crucial.
