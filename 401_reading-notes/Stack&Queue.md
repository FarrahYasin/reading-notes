# Readings: Stack & Queue

**Read: Stack & Queue** ðŸ’»

  ***why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module?***
     Stacks and queues are both abstract data types used in  programming. They are used in different scenarios based on the order of the element removal.
I want to learn more about this topic for use it during this course .

### Stack:
A stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, similar to a stack of boxs. The last box placed on top is the first box to be removed. In a stack, elements are added and removed from the same end, referred to as the "top" of the stack.

 we have **two main operations** In a **stack:**
**Push:**  to adds an element to the top of the stack.
**Pop:** to  removes and returns the element from the top of the stack.
These operations maintain the order of elements in the stack. When a new element is pushed onto the stack, it becomes the new top, and the previous elements remain beneath it.

Stacks are useful in scenarios that involve a need for temporary storage or tracking of elements in a specific order. Some common applications of stacks include managing function calls, expression evaluation, undo/redo operations, and backtracking algorithms.

### Queue:
A queue follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, similar to a queue of people waiting in line. The person who arrives first is the first one to be served. In a queue, elements are added at one end, called the "tail," and removed from the other end, called the "head" of the queue.

we have **two primary operations** In a **queue:**

**Enqueue:**to adds an element to the end of the queue.
**Dequeue:** to removes and returns the element from the head of the queue.
These operations maintain the order of elements in the queue. When a new element is enqueued, it joins the end of the queue, and the existing elements retain their positions.

Queues are used in scenarios where the order of processing matters. They are useful for managing task scheduling, and implementing algorithms like breadth-first search, where exploring neighboring elements in a particular order is important.

**difference between both of them:**
The key difference between a stack and a queue lies in the order of element removal. In a stack, the last element added (top) is the first one to be removed, following the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Conversely, in a queue, the first element added (front) is the first one to be removed, adhering to the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
