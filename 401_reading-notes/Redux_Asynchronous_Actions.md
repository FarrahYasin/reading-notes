# Readings: Redux - Asynchronous Actions

#### async actions
**1.Why use Redux middleware?**
>Redux middleware serves the purpose of intercepting and managing actions before they reach the reducer. It offers a means to introduce additional logic or side effects into your Redux application. Common scenarios for using middleware include handling asynchronous actions, logging, routing, and more. Middleware provides a way to extend and customize Redux's behavior without cluttering your reducers with intricate logic.

**2.Consider the Redux Async Data Flow Diagram. Describe the flow in your own words.**
>In the Redux Async Data Flow, when you dispatch an asynchronous action, it typically goes through the following steps:
>
>* Action Dispatch: You initiate an action, which can be an object describing a task, like fetching data from an API.
>
>* Middleware: The action traverses any middleware you've configured. Middleware can intercept and process actions. In the case of asynchronous actions, middleware like Redux Thunk can intercept them and execute additional logic.
>
>* Thunk Function: If Redux Thunk middleware is in use, the asynchronous action you dispatch is, in fact, a thunk function, not a plain action object. This thunk function can include asynchronous code, such as API requests.
>
>* Asynchronous Operation: Inside the thunk function, you can perform asynchronous tasks, such as making API requests or setting timers.
>
>* Dispatching Additional Actions: Asynchronous operations are typically non-blocking, allowing you to dispatch additional actions during this period. These actions might signal the start, success, or failure of the asynchronous operation.
>
>* Reducer: Finally, after the asynchronous operation concludes, or any other pertinent actions are dispatched, the reducer is invoked. The reducer updates the state based on the received actions.

**3.How are we accommodating async in our Redux app?**
>In Redux applications, we commonly handle asynchronous operations, like fetching data from an API, by employing middleware, such as Redux Thunk.

#### thunk middleware

**1.Why would you need redux-thunk middleware?**
>Redux Thunk middleware becomes necessary when you need to create action creators that return a function instead of a direct action object. This function, known as a thunk, can contain asynchronous code. You use Redux Thunk middleware when you want to dispatch actions that rely on the outcomes of asynchronous operations, such as API requests.

**3.Describe how any return value from the inner thunk function will be made available.**
>Typically, the return value from the inner thunk function is a promise. Redux Thunk handles this promise automatically. When the asynchronous operation within the thunk completes (e.g., when an API request finishes), Redux Thunk dispatches the appropriate actions based on the outcome of that operation. This facilitates the dispatching of actions to indicate success or failure and allows for updating the Redux store accordingly.
>
>For instance, if you have a thunk that fetches data from an API, you can dispatch a loading action at the start, a success action upon successful completion, and an error action in case of an error. Redux Thunk ensures that these actions are dispatched at the appropriate times based on the results of the asynchronous operation.
