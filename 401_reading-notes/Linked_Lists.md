 ***why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module?***
Linked list has a  dynamic and flexible way of organizing data and linked list make the data useful when we need to  insertion and deletion operations are efficient.

## What is Linked List?

linked list is a data structure, we use this data structure to store and organize the (**Node**(collection of elements):contain value and pointer(this pointer refere to the next node in the list)).
called the first node in the linked list( head), each node points to next node, but last node in the linked list points to null

## Why we use Linked List?

Linked list has a  dynamic and flexible way of organizing data and linked list make the data useful when we need to  insertion and deletion operations are efficient.

## what is the big O notation?
Big O notation is a way to describe efficiency of algorithms as the input size grows.
in Big O notation we have worst-case scenario and space complexity of an algorithm, we can choose and compare the algorithms and choose one of them based on problem's requirements and input sizes, to avoid the algorithm that will may become  inefficient to use.
This is some examples:O(1),O(n),O(n^2),O(log n),O(n log n)
