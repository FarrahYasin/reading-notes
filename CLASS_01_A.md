**Read: Class 01 a** ðŸ’»ðŸ“’

  ***why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module?***
     Node.js very important technology in the web development, has ability to handle high concurrency, , and it has many uses for building many types of apps.
I want to learn more about this topic for use it   during this course .
1. ## How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?
Node.js is environment that allow us to run code on computer not only on web browsers, this help us a lot to control over how our website work.
Node.js support modern JavaScript very well, it is asyncrounous I/O run time and it is non-blocking.
the Node contain JavaScript engine (V8) to run the code and more features.

2. ## What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?

 4. **Command line tools:**
we can use Node.js to build command line tools also.
