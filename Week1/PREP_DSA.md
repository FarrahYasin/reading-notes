 ***why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module?***
    Data Structures and Algorithms it is a basic concept we must to learn it because it is very important to solve the complex problems in efficient way.


### 1.What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

I think the time that the algorithm take it to run (Time Complexity) of the that execute on data structure

### 2.How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
 Define a base case to stops the recursion function

## Things I want to know more about
I want to learn Data Structure & Algorithms  and understand the recursionðŸ˜Š
