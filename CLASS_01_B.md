 ***why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module?***


**<span style="color:purple">An introduction to NodeJS and Express</span>**

1. ### Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.
By using middleware(Node.js function), we can expand the functionality of the program without redesigning it again, it is easy to use middleware in many applications, we can also use middleware to create node.js apps, where we can add many features to the application without redesigning it again, and this means that middleware is a very effective tool for creating applications.

2. ### Express the most popular __ __ ____.
 Express the most popular **Node web framework.**

3. ### Express is ‚Äúunopinionated.‚Äù What does that mean?
This means that Express does not impose a specific method or rule for creating a web application. Express allows programmers to choose the libraries and tools they want in order to create the application. Express provides APIs and features for creating web applications while allowing decision-making from the developer. This helps programmers have more control. in choosing the tools they need.

4. ### What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?
modules is a JavaScript library/file, and using Node's we can import this library  into other code, using this function require() .
We  can consider Express as a module also , like database libraries and like middleware that we used it in Express apps.
module is useful to us as developer because it makes the code easier to read and understand, and in addition to that the modules makes it easy to correct programming errors in the code by separating it into modules.


**<span style="color:purple">What is NPM?</span>**

1. ### What version of npm are you running on your machine?
9.5.0

3. ### What command would you type to install a library/package called ‚Äòjshint‚Äô into your node project?
npm i jshint



**<span style="color:purple">What is TDD</span>**

1. ### Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.
TDD is very important because it always makes programmers think about program design before starting to write the code, in addition to writing tests that make us make sure that the code works correctly and without errors, and rebuilding the code according to accepted standards.

2. ### What are three expected benefits of testing
One of the benefits of TDD is that it helps improve design quality in the code, and improves cohesion and coupling metrics as well. In addition, TDD helps reduce effort in the final stages of building a project.

3. ### Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.

**Individual pitfalls:**
1. Forgetting to do tests permanently.
2. Doing a lot of tests at the same time.

**Team pitfalls:**
1. Poor maintenance,like forgetting test suite that is rarely run or never run.
2. Having people on the team who don't use TDD.


**<span style="color:purple">CI/CD</span>**

1. ### What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?
It allows for expansion as the  Continuous Integration provides the ability to work on different parts of the code by programmers, and allows them to easily integrate their work and the changes or modifications they add to the code, in addition to that it improves communication between programmers and other stakeholders, and improves cooperation between them.

2. ### What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and  Continuous Deployment?
**Continuous Delivery:** 
The goal of Continuous Delivery is to ensure that the build status of the project is always deployable or ready for deploy.
**Continuous Deployment:**
It means the method of automatically deploying  the code in production after  completion of all checks and the completion of all tests as well.


3. ### Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background
GitHub  do an essential role in the process of continuous delivery and continuous deployment, because GitHub provides a system for version control, automation, and collaboration as well, as GitHub helps programmers store code in a repository that others can access, as GitHub allows programmers to track modifications and updates to code Effectively, as GitHub facilitates integration support, because there are tools that help in this, such as: Jenkins, CircleCI, for example, where these tools can be used and code analysis is performed whenever new changes are pushed to the GitHub repository. GitHub provides integrations and features to enable Continuous publishing, which helps programmers to deliver quickly and without delay, and easy to correct errors, if any, so GitHub helps work efficiently, quickly, and more reliably.
