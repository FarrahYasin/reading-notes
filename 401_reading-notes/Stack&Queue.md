# Readings: Stack & Queue

**Read: Stack & Queue** ðŸ’»

 ***Why is the topic of stacks and queues important in relation to your studies in this module?***
 Both stacks and queues are abstract data types that are utilized in programming. Depending on the order in which elements are removed, Stacks and queues are both abstract data types used in  programming. They are used in different scenarios based on the order of the element removal.
I want to learn more about this topic for use it during this course .

## Stack:
A stack operates on the Last-In-First-Out **(LIFO)** principle, similar to a stack of boxes for example,the last box placed on top is the first one to be removed. In a stack, elements are added and removed from the same end, referred to as the "top" of the stack.
we have operations maintain the order of items in the stack,
To add an item we can use**(Push Operation)** this operation will add items to the top of the stack.
and if we want to delete an item we can use **(Pop operations )**, this Pop operations will delete and returns the item from the top of the stack

---

**More description:**
 When we push a new item onto the stack, it becomes the new top of this stack, and the previous item remain beneath it.

**Why Stacks?**
Stack is very useful in scenarios that involve temporary storage or the tracking of elements in a specific order. Common applications of stacks include managing function calls, evaluating expressions, performing undo/redo operations, and implementing backtracking algorithms.

## Queue:
A queue operates on the First-In-First-Out **(FIFO)** principle, similar to a queue of people waiting in line. The person who arrives first is the first one to be served. In a queue, items are added at one end, called the "tail," and  deleted from the other end, called the "head" of the queue.
we have operations to deal with the order of items in the queue,
if we want to add a new item we can use this operation**(Enqueue operation)** this operation will adds an item to the end of the queue.
and if we want to delete a new item we can use this operation **(Dequeue operation)** to delete and returns the item from the head of the queue.

---

**More description:**
When a new item is enqueued, it joins the end of the queue, while the existing items retain their positions.

---

**why Queue?**
Queues is important,we can use it where the order of processing is significant.we can use it for managing task scheduling and implementing algorithms like breadth-first search, where exploring neighboring elements in a specific order is essential.

**The difference between stacks and queues** 
lies in the order of element removal. In a stack, the last element added (top) is the first one to be removed, following the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. On the other hand, in a queue, the first element added (front) is the first one to be removed, adhering to the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
