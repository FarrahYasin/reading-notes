# Graph
>Graphs are essentially a combination of nodes (also called vertices) and edges, which serve to establish connections between pairs of nodes. Each edge signifies a specific relationship between two nodes, and graphs are exceptionally versatile, offering the ability to model a wide array of situations, including networks, social interactions, maps, and more.
>
>Graphs stand as a potent and versatile data structure, enabling the representation and analysis of relationships between entities. Their capacity to capture interconnectedness positions them as a fundamental tool within computer science and across diverse real-world scenarios.
>
> Varieties of Graphs:
>
>Directed Graph (Digraph): In this type, edges possess a particular direction. An edge from node A to node B signifies a one-way connection.
>
>Undirected Graph: These graphs have edges without any specific direction; connections between nodes A and B work in both directions.
>Weighted Graph: Here, edges carry weights or costs, which can represent distances between locations, for instance.
>Unweighted Graph: These graphs lack associated weights; the edges are without any additional information.
Key Elements of a Graph:
>
>Nodes (Vertices): These represent the entities within the graph.
Edges: These establish connections between node pairs, symbolizing relationships.
Adjacency: Nodes connected by an edge are considered adjacent to each other.
Degree of a Node: This measures the number of edges linked to a node.
Path: A sequence of nodes, where each node connects to the next through an edge.
Cycle: A path that both starts and ends at the same node.
Connected Graph: In this type, every node can be reached from any other node.
Disconnected Graph: It consists of multiple connected components.
Ways to Represent a Graph:
>
>Adjacency Matrix: This is a 2D array, where cell (i, j) indicates whether there's an edge from node i to node j.
Adjacency List: It's an array of linked lists where each node's list contains its adjacent nodes.
Graphs serve as a powerful framework for modeling and resolving real-world problems centered around relationships and connections. They find applications in various domains, including:
>
>Social networks: To model friendships and connections.
Transportation systems: For mapping roads, flights, or train routes.
Computer networks: To depict connections between devices.
Recommendation systems: In suggesting friends, products, or content.
